# WORK DAY PLANNER

## USAGE

This day planner is designed to display time slots from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to represent the user's work day.  When the user enters input into the task description, the app will accept and store the text value to be displayed as tasks, or to-dos, for any time slot the user wants.  The text values will be saved in local storage in the web browser, and will be saved even if the web browser is refreshed, or closed and reopened.  

This application also features a clock that displays the correct time upon opening.  This clock is used as a reference to color the current hour in red, the future in green, and the past in gray.  The description task section will be colored according to the current hour at the time the app is opened.
